(*
  p is undecidable if decidability of p implies co-enumerability of L halting.
  Since L halting is enumerable, its co-enumerability would imply its decidability.
  Instead of L halting, any other enumerable, many-one equivalent problem to L halting suffices. 
  For example (cf. [2]):
    Post correspondence problem (cf. [1, Lemma 2.26]),
    binary stack machine halting,
    two-counter machine halting,
    Diophantine constraint solvability, ...
