  (* locations: index type for instructions, normally is nat *)

  Variables loc : Set.

  (* four instructions: STOPₙ, INCₙ, DECₙ and ZEROₙ (test) 

     only two nat valued registers, indexed with bool
     ie true/α of which the values are denoted "a" below
     and false/β of which the values are denoted "b" below 

     In any of the cases above, several instructions can 
     co-exist at a given location, hence, no instruction
     can stop the computation by itself. This model is
     inherently no-deterministic.

     STOPₙ p:     accepts location p when α = β = 0
     INCₙ x p q:  at location p, x += 1 and jumps to location q
     DECₙ x p q:  at location p, x -= 1 (if possible) and jumps to location q
                  if x is already 0 then this instruction cannot compute
     ZEROₙ x p q: at location p, jumps to location q when x = 0

  (* Programs are non-deterministic and described by 
     a (finite) list of instructions 

     Notice that eg 

          [ STOPₙ 0 ; INCₙ α 0 4 ; DECₙ β 0 2 ]

     can both accept location 0 (if α = β = 0)
     or increment α and jump to location 4
     or decrement β (if not zero already) and jump to location 2

     Also repetitions and order do not matter hence these
     lists are viewed as finite sets, see ndmm2_accept_mono 
     in ndMM2/ndmm2_utils.v
